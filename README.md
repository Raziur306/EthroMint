# EthroMint

Welcome to EthroMint! This project aims to demonstrate the process of minting a token using OpenZepplin and hosting it on the Ethereum blockchain. Additionally, a basic frontend interface is provided to interact with the smart contract, allowing the contract owner to send tokens to other wallets.

## Overview

EthroMint is a simple project showcasing the following key features:

- Token Minting: Utilizing OpenZepplin libraries, a token is created and deployed to the Ethereum blockchain.
- Frontend Interface: A basic web interface is provided to interact with the smart contract, allowing the contract owner to manage token transactions.
- Ethereum Blockchain Integration: The project leverages the Ethereum blockchain for secure and decentralized token management.

## Features

- **Token Minting**: The project allows for the creation and deployment of a custom token on the Ethereum blockchain.
- **Frontend Interface**: Users can interact with the smart contract through a simple web interface to perform token transactions.
- **Ownership Management**: The contract owner has the ability to send tokens to other Ethereum wallets directly from the frontend interface.

## Getting Started

To get started with EthroMint, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the necessary dependencies using `npm install`.
3. Compile and deploy the smart contract to the Ethereum blockchain.
4. Run the frontend application to interact with the smart contract.

## Technologies Used

- **Solidity**: Smart contract development.
- **OpenZepplin**: Library for secure smart contract development **ERC20**.
- **Ethereum**: Blockchain platform for deploying and managing the token.
- **Thirdweb**: Platform for hosting the contract & connecting it with the Frontend.
- **Next.Js/HTML/CSS/TypeScript**: Frontend development for the user interface.
